Steps to use HelioSoil to estimate soiling in troughs for FieldStatus,
assume each PT mirror is flat for first cut:
	- Sun tracking function and geometry relations for PT mirrors
	- Optical efficiency calculation for PT
	- lift assumption that all mirrors are the same size
	- Remove stow angle limitations (not sure if any implications in rest of code)
